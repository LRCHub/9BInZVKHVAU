[00:02.01] (Hoo!)
[00:05.01] 
[00:02.66] I remember late nights, pissy hallways driving me psycho
[00:06.79] The money wouldn't come fast enough
[00:08.77] We was back and forth, down streamline
[00:11.16] Moving weight was like lipo, the rest of y'all stuck in a rut
[00:14.84] Niggas double-crossing, talk behind yo' back
[00:17.15] See, that's where the knife go, I guess they wasn't fuckin' wit' us
[00:20.91] Some niggas get the luck of the draw
[00:23.19] For others, life is a dice roll, and waiting on faith ain't for us
[00:56.19] 
[00:26.85] When you young, you realize that you can't trust a mouth where the pipe go
[00:31.10] They tried but couldn't love you enough
[00:33.04] Dance music on my neck, where's your water bottle?
[00:35.79] Diamonds, the light show, looking like the sun in the club
[00:39.02] If you re-ing up with us then your credit score gotta be F.I.C.O., I'm talkin' 850 or bust
[00:44.97] See you really real power when you make niggas balance on tight ropes
[00:49.16] They know they not much for the blood
[01:07.66] 
[00:51.27] Have my man shoot yo' block, I'ma send his ass far as the flight go
[00:55.32] Ain't worried 'bout ducking a judge
[00:57.35] Keep frontin' for yo' bitches, 'cause any minute repo might show
[01:01.23] You know that shit up in a month
[01:03.33] Heard your man was in there singing for his life, they was calling him maestro
[01:07.35] 'Cause time that heavy can crush
[01:09.31] When you pay a nigga back, like it's layaway, whispering, "Die slow"
[01:13.51] The last words you hear in the trunk
[01:31.51] 
[01:15.71] You don't know what I know
[01:18.83] You ain't seen what I saw, no
[01:22.03] You ain't been where I go
[01:24.59] Wit' a fetti so strong, you gotta bag it wit' one eye closed
[01:28.68] My shooter turn you inside out
[01:31.07] I heard the Feds turned the crib inside out
[01:33.85] Drop the roof on you niggas, let the inside out
[01:37.10] Fresh Prince jacket, boy, I cook 'em 'til they inside out
[02:05.60] 
[01:40.24] Go get a Glock, 27 fits snug in the waistline
[01:43.95] Both sticks came with the drum
[01:45.97] I was 5'6", shoulder with a chip, wish a nigga to take mine
[01:49.99] Index yanked 'til it's numb
[01:51.99] Used to call me Windex 'cause this thing I spray gon' make you change minds
[01:55.91] I done seen Hercules run
[01:58.10] We was powerlifting 2.2's, nah, we ain't throw gang signs
[02:02.07] My brick walk was second to none
[02:18.07] 
[02:04.04] I would have them take a number like DMV, that was the baseline
[02:08.39] Checkout on register one
[02:10.29] Miami niggas like Big Perm 'cause they numbers was Faizon
[02:14.23] Cubans showed me nothing but love
[02:16.31] When it come down to it, every Stringer Bell just needs an Avon
[02:20.37] Who won't sweep it under the rug
[02:22.40] On the road, with a load, nigga, break line, I knew where to place mine
[02:26.38] I don't keep the gun in the glove
[02:42.88] 
[02:28.40] Hit the turnpike with the running lights that be on in the daytime
[02:32.45] 'Cause K9s sniff out a crumb
[02:34.71] Hands three and nine on the wheel as I'm crossing the state line
[02:38.61] Dumb, ditty, dumb, ditty, dumb
[02:40.89] Survival of the fittest, you either get acquitted or face time
[02:44.62] I done had an infamous run
[02:46.73] My story gon' hit the first 48
[02:49.21] Then it's on Dateline 'cause this really shit I'd done
[03:16.21] 
[02:52.84] You don't know what I know
[02:55.95] You ain't seen what I saw, no
[02:59.11] You ain't been where I go
[03:01.83] Wit' a fetti so strong you gotta bag it wit' one eye closed
[03:05.92] My shooter turn you inside out
[03:08.25] I heard the Feds turned the crib inside out
[03:11.03] Drop the roof on you niggas, let the inside out
[03:14.17] Fresh Prince jacket, boy, I cook 'em 'til they inside out
